This folder's subfolders contain Matlab demo scripts for PET and MR reconstruction.

The folder YOUR_PATH/build/install/bin (see SIRF/INSTALL.txt) must be in Windows path,
and the folder YOUR_PATH/build/install/matlab in Matlab path.

To use Matlab doc feature on demo scripts, you also need to add folders 
YOUR_PATH/SIRF/examples/Matlab/MR and YOUR_PATH/SIRF/examples/Matlab/PET and their 
sub-folders to Matlab path.

Please also see the Wiki page on Examples (MR).
