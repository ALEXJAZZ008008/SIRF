This folder's subfolders contain Python demo scripts for PET and MR reconstruction.

Folder YOUR_PATH/build/install/python (see SIRF/INSTALL.txt for the value of YOUR_PATH)
must be in Python path.

To run demo scripts, you are advised either to create an environment variable 
SRC_PATH with the value YOUR_PATH, or SIRF_PATH with the value YOUR_PATH/SIRF, otherwise 
you will have to give full path to raw data files via command-line options -p or --path.
NOTE: even on Windows, you must use / in paths.
