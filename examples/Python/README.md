This folder's subfolders contain Python demo scripts for PET and MR reconstruction.

Note that the SIRF Python utilities should be in your `PYTHONPATH` (see the
installation instructions).

To run the demo scripts, please create an environment variable 
`SIRF_PATH` with as value the location of your SIRF source, e.g. 
`/home/sirfuser/devel/SIRF`.
If you do not do this, you can still run the non-interactive demos but
you will have to give full path to raw data files via 
command-line options `-p` or `--path`.

NOTE: on Windows, you must use / in paths, not \\.
