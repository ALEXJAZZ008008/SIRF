Please check the SIRF Wiki for more detailed installation instructions.

Instructions are for CMake that is not older than 3.7.2.

Instructions assume that Boost, SWIG, HDF5_1.8.18, FFTW3 and ismrmrd packages are 
installed and you know the paths to their root folders. They also assume that you 
installed STIR using CMake and cloned SIRF repository from CCPPETMR:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF 

in a folder referred to below as YOUR_PATH. 

You need to create folder named build in YOUR_PATH with a subfolder install. 
YOUR_PATH/build/install/bin (will be created by installation) must be in the path of your OS (or shell).
The folder YOUR_PATH/build/install/python must be in the Python path (i.e. listed in PYTHONPATH
environment variable value) and folder YOUR_PATH/build/install/matlab in the Matlab path.

To run the demos, create an environment variable SIRF_PATH with the value YOUR_PATH/SIRF.

To use Matlab doc feature on demo scripts, you also need to add folders YOUR_PATH/SIRF/examples/Matlab/
its sub-folders to the Matlab path. You could do that in MATLAB as follows

   addpath(genpath(fullfile(getenv('SIRF_PATH'),'SIRF/examples/Matlab')))  

=====
LINUX
=====

Set/export (depending on your Linux shell) the following variables:

INSTALL_DIR=YOUR_PATH/build/install
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PYTHONPATH=$INSTALL_DIR/python:$PYTHONPATH
CMAKE="cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/lib/cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$INSTALL_DIR"

Change to YOUR_PATH/build and do

mkdir SIRF
cd SIRF
$CMAKE YOUR_PATH/SIRF
make install

=======
WINDOWS
=======
This is currently still very hard due to the many dependencies in SIRF. These will need to be installed
separately. See https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF/wiki/Installation-instructions for more details.

General remarks
---------------

Instructions are for CMake GUI (use at least CMake 3.7.2).


For selecting folder and file paths click on the value field of a CMake variable and
then click on button marked ... on the right-hand side. If the folder you select does 
not exist yet, you can create it in CMake Select Path window.

WARNING: during CMake configuration you may see various error messages, some times in pop-up windows. 
These are likely to be caused by CMake not yet finding the relevant packages or CMake bugs - carry on with the steps
given below regardless (as we did).

----------------

Start CMake GUI. Check Advanced.

Select YOUR_PATH/SIRF folder as Source and YOUR_PATH/build/SIRF folder as Build.

Click Configure.

Select correct generator: e.g. when using Visual Studio 2015, select Visual Studio 2014
and click Finish.

If Boost_INCLUDE_DIR is not found, set it, and also BOOST_ROOT, to the path to 
Boost root folder.

Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to YOUR_PATH/build/install.

Set MATLAB_DEST to YOUR_PATH/build/install/matlab.

Set PYTHON_DEST to YOUR_PATH/build/install/python.

Set SWIG_EXECUTABLE to the filepath (<path>/<filename>) to swig.exe.

Click Configure.

If FFTW3F_LIBRARY is not found, set it to the filepath to libfftw3f-3.lib.

If FFTW3_INCLUDE_DIR is not found, set it to the path to FFTW3 folder.

If STIR_DIR is not foun, set it to YOUR_PATH/build/install/lib/cmake.

Click Configure.

If HDF5 is not found, set HDF5_C_INCLUDE_DIR to <HDF5_ROOT>/include and 
the value of HDF5_hdf5_LIBRARY_RELEASE to C:/Packages/HDF5/1.8.18/lib/libhdf5.lib
(or where you installed HDF5)

Check the box SIRF_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.

Click Configure.

Click Generate.

Click Open Project.

Select Release as Solution Configuration and x64 as Solution Platform.

Click Build and select Build Solution.

Right-click INSTALL in Solution Explorer and select Build.

NOTE: even on Windows, you might have to use / in paths for environment variables etc
