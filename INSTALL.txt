Instructions are for CMake that is not older than 3.7.2.

Instructions assume that Boost, SWIG, HDF5_1.8.18, FFTW3 and ismrmrd packages are 
installed and you know the paths to their root folders. They also assume that you 
installed STIR using CMake and cloned SIRF repository from CCPPETMR:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF 

in a folder referred to below as YOUR_PATH. 

You need to create folder named build in YOUR_PATH with a subfolder install. 
YOUR_PATH/build/install/bin (will be created by installation) must be in Windows path.
Folder YOUR_PATH/build/install/python must be in Python path (i.e. listed in PYTHONPATH
environment variable value) and folder YOUR_PATH/build/install/matlab in Matlab path.
To use Matlab doc feature you, also need to add YOUR_PATH/SIRF/examples/Matlab/MR and
YOUR_PATH/SIRF/examples/Matlab/PET and their sub-folders to Matlab path.

=====
LINUX
=====

Set/export (depending on your Linux shell) the following variables:

INSTALL_DIR=YOUR_PATH/build/install
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PYTHONPATH=$INSTALL_DIR/python:$PYTHONPATH
CMAKE="cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/lib/cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$INSTALL_DIR"

Change to YOUR_PATH/build and do

mkdir SIRF
cd SIRF
$CMAKE YOUR_PATH/SIRF
make install

General remarks
---------------

Instructions are for CMake GUI.

For selecting folder and file paths click on the value field of a CMake variable and
then click on button marked ... on the right-hand side. If the folder you select does 
not exist yet, you can create it in CMake Select Path window.

WARNING: during installation you may see various error messages. These are likely to
be caused by CMake bugs - carry on regardless (as we did).

----------------

Start CMake GUI.

Select YOUR_PATH/SIRF folder as Source and YOUR_PATH/build/SIRF folder as Build.

Click Configure.

Select correct generator: e.g. when using Visual Studio 2015, select Visual Studio 2014
and click Finish.

If Boost_INCLUDE_DIR is not found, set it, and also BOOST_ROOT, to the path to 
Boost root folder.

Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to YOUR_PATH/build/install.

Set MATLAB_DEST to YOUR_PATH/build/install/matlab.

Set PYTHON_DEST to YOUR_PATH/build/install/python.

Set SWIG_EXECUTABLE to the filepath (<path>/<filename>) to swig.exe.

Click Configure.

If FFTW3F_LIBRARY is not found, set it to the filepath to libfftw3f-3.lib.

If FFTW3_INCLUDE_DIR is not found, set it to the path to FFTW3 folder.

If STIR_DIR is not foun, set it to YOUR_PATH/build/install/lib/cmake.

Click Configure.

Set the value of HDF5_hdf5_LIBRARY_RELEASE to C:/Packages/HDF5/1.8.18/lib/libhdf5.lib.

Check the box agains SIRF_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.
